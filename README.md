## Common mistakes with current microwave design
* Buttons are all over the place/not in a easy to read format
* Clock is too small
* No metal detector in microwave (not kid friendly)
* Hard to tell what is going on from a far

## How I solved these issues
* Screen turns green when the microwave is on, that way we know it is on even when we have headphones on
* I removed the stop/start button because that is really just one more button to press
* increased the size of the clock to make sure you can see it from afar
* Reorganized the buttons to be easy on the eyes. Made sure them thicker to make is easier to press
* The preset buttons are bigger so that they would be used more
